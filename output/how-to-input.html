<h1>How to input for GAMstack</h1>
<p>Just write a Markdown note. Seriously, that's it. No YAML, no JSON, no &quot;microservice orchestration pipeline.&quot; Just Markdown. It's like writing a love letter to simplicity.</p>
<p>You can use VS Code, or directly create a file on GitHub. Heck, you could even use Notepad if you're feeling nostalgic. Anything goes as long as the <code>.md</code> file lands in this sacred <code>/input/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Yes. It's that simple. No, really. Stop overthinking it.</p>
<h2>How will I know that the magic works?</h2>
<p>You will see this file in the <code>/output/</code> folder. Yes, you. Reading this file. Twice. First as a humble <code>.md</code> file, and then as a glorious <code>.html</code> file. It's like watching your code grow up and graduate.</p>
<h2>See you on the HTML side!</h2>
<p>(And don't forget to wave at your Markdown file on the way out. It worked hard to get here.)</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>
