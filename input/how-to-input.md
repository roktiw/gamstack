# How to input for GAMstack

Just write a Markdown note. Seriously, that's it. No YAML, no JSON, no "microservice orchestration pipeline." Just Markdown. It's like writing a love letter to simplicity.

You can use VS Code, or directly create a file on GitHub. Heck, you could even use Notepad if you're feeling nostalgic. Anything goes as long as the `.md` file lands in this sacred `/input/` folder.

Yes. It's that simple. No, really. Stop overthinking it.

## How will I know that the magic works?

You will see this file in the `/output/` folder. Yes, you. Reading this file. Twice. First as a humble `.md` file, and then as a glorious `.html` file. It's like watching your code grow up and graduate.

## See you on the HTML side!

(And don't forget to wave at your Markdown file on the way out. It worked hard to get here.)
